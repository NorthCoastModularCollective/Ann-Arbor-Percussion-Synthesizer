# Ann Arbor Percussion Synthesizer

A module that generates “abstract” percussion sounds and has a fairly simple interface. It won’t be intended to create “bass drums” or “snares” or “hi hats”, though it’ll probably be able to make things that approximate those sounds. It is raw, dirty, glitchy, lo-fi, and abstract. A Banksy interpretation of a Dali painting of industrial-steam-punk-Qbert. Interacting with it gives you a feeling of exploration and discovery with little emphasis on predictability and reproducibility. However, great care was taken to make the experience not feel like pure chaos and randomness. 


CAUTION: this project is still in development. There are many bugs and gaps.
